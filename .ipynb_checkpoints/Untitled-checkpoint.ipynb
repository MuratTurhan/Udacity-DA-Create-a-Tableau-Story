    "## Baseball Players Tableau Story Analysis\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, baseball players data set is used to create an explanatory data visualization with Tableau. Findings, insights and relations about baseball players performance factors are visualized with charts, dashboard and Tableasu story.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Visualizations :** https://public.tableau.com/profile/murat5974#!/vizhome/Initial_Visualizations/Story1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Visualizations :** https://public.tableau.com/profile/murat5974#!/vizhome/Final_Visualizations_0/Story1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Tableau techniques is used to represent Baseball players data with various visualizations. Home Runs and Batting Average relations with Height and Weight are explored. A new variable Height/Weight ratio is help to find more insights on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, it is explored that players with about 73 inches and 190 pounds are predicted to perform better than other players without Handedness effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, data set is checked and created any possible chart to see relations. Handedness versus number of players, Batting Rate and Home Runs are visualized with bar charts. Height and weight effects on Batting Average and Home Runs are shown with line charts. The correlation of Home Runs and Batting Rate is visualized by changing measuring to dimention. Finally, all charts added to dashboard and the Tableau story is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "In final visualization according the feedbacks, a new variable is created; Height/Weight Ratio with raounded 2 values. It helps us to find more insignts on effects. Height and Weight details also added to chart. Dimension and metric names are changed to understand meanings better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changed chart type of Handedness versus Batting Ratio, Home Runs and Number Of Players to circle and added boxplot from analyse part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Titles are given correctly for all visualizations. Size of charts at story is changed fo better view. Also selected first sheet before saving story cause, it is shown as cover visualization at Tableau public.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is hard to understand the attributes and metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Their names are corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Height and Weight visualizations gives weak insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "New variable is created; Height/Weight Ratio with rounded values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are no names of visualizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "All names are given for better analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**I t is better to give details for top values of visualizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating new variable, it become mandatory to give details so they are given.\n",
